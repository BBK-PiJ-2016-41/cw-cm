Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Good set of tests.

The constructor for CMImpl is quite long; consider refactoring 
to use additional (private) methods.

There is some similarity between some of the methods which 
suggests refactoring could be applied. Most usefully some Java 8
constructs may have helped reduce the codebase and should be
considered going forward.

If you are going to explicitly throw an exception from a method
then include an appropriate "throws" clause in the method signature
regardless of wether the exception is checked or not. This is just
good documentation and means that the user of your api will not
receive any nasty surprises.

Very good attempt. Distinction.
